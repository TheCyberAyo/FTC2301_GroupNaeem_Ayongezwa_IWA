<!-- IWA_9.2: Challenge 1
This challenge is an updated version of a previous challenge using object literals.

 

Once again, you will need to ensure that the following behaviour works:

The taxable amount should be subtracted from the salary before expenses are calculated
The total should be the result of the after-tax amount with all expenses subtracted
 

However, there are some differences from the first time you encountered this functionality:

All expenses are grouped in the expenses object.
Instead of having a hardcoded tax amount, there is a tax object that has several reference codes we can use to get different tax amounts. The one that we will use is 913
Rent is listed using keys that are created from a combination of loading types and sizes.
The matching key for rent should be created by interpolating the size and lodging variables provided.
The number provided by this key should be used as the rent amount.
You donâ€™t have to worry about having space separators between numbers in this version, you can just log it as a single number value, rounded to two decimal places.
 

The final value that should be logged to the console should be: 2658.05-->
