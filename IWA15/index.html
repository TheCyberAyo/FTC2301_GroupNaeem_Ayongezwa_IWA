<!--In the following exercise, you will need to extract the numbers from all three arrays in 
    lists inside the data object and combine all values into a new single array called result.

The extractBiggest function will be run 15 times and will grab a single number and add it 
to the result array (as per the bottom section of the code that you are not allowed to edit).

You will need to ensure that the extractBiggest function looks at the last item in each 
of the three lists and selects the biggest one. It should remove the value from the current 
array under lists and move it to the results array. Running the code below should result in 
the following array being logged to the console:

[10, 12, 14, 5, 7, 13, 11, 15, 4, 8, 6, 2, 1, 3, 9]

 
While the code runs, it logs the incorrect arrays, as seen below:

[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

 
Please update the code between the two comments below so that the correct array value is logged.

Summary:

Edit only the code between the two comment lines
The code must compare the last value of each provided array
The largest value must be removed from itâ€™s array
The largest value must be added to the result array
 

Extra reading material and tools to help you complete this challenge:
 

In this challenge there are several issues with the code. Use what you have learned about arrays, 
destructuring, comparison operators and logical operators to debug the code.
